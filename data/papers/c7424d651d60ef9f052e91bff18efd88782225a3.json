{"title": "How Hard Is It to Control an Election by Breaking Ties?", "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of controlling the result of an election by breaking ties strategically. This problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner of an election under parallel universes tie-breaking. When the chair of the election is only asked to break ties to choose between one of the co-winners, the problem is trivially easy. However, in multi-round elections, we prove that it can be NP-hard for the chair to compute how to break ties to ensure a given result. Additionally, we show that the form of the tie-breaking function can increase the opportunities for control. Indeed, we prove that it can be NP-hard to control an election by breaking ties even with a two-stage voting rule.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "c7424d651d60ef9f052e91bff18efd88782225a3", "arXivId": "1304.6174", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.6174.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "Nina Narodytska", "T.
