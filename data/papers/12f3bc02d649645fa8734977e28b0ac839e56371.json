{"title": "Optimizing curbside parking resources subject to congestion constraints", "abstract": "To gain theoretical insight into the relationship between parking scarcity and congestion, we describe block-faces of curbside parking as a network of queues. Due to the nature of this network, canonical queueing network results are not available to us. We present a new kind of queueing network subject to customer rejection due to the lack of available servers. We provide conditions for such networks to be stable, a tractable \u201csingle node\u201d view of such a network, and show that maximizing the occupancy through price control of such queues, and subject to constraints on the allowable congestion between queues searching for an available server, is a convex optimization problem. We demonstrate an application of this method in the Mission District of San Francisco; our results suggest congestion due to drivers searching for parking stems from an inefficient spatial utilization of parking resources.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "12f3bc02d649645fa8734977e28b0ac839e56371", "arXivId": "1703.07802", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07802.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Chase P.
