Abstract
Most language modeling methods rely on large-scale data to statistically learn the sequential patterns of words. In this paper, we argue that words are atomic language units but not necessarily atomic semantic units. Inspired by HowNet, we use sememes, the minimum semantic units in human languages, to represent the implicit semantics behind words for language modeling, named Sememe-Driven Language Model (SDLM). More speciﬁcally, to predict the next word, SDLM ﬁrst estimates the sememe distribution given textual context. Afterwards, it regards each sememe as a distinct semantic expert, and these experts jointly identify the most probable senses and the corresponding word. In this way, SDLM enables language models to work beyond word-level manipulation to ﬁne-grained sememe-level semantics, and offers us more powerful tools to ﬁne-tune language models and improve the interpretability as well as the robustness of language models. Experiments on language modeling and the downstream application of headline generation demonstrate the signiﬁcant effectiveness of SDLM.

1 Introduction
Language Modeling (LM) aims to measure the probability of a word sequence, reﬂecting its ﬂuency and likelihood as a feasible sentence in a human language. Language Modeling is an essential component in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as Machine Translation (Brown et al., 1990; Brants et al., 2007), Speech Recognition (Katz, 1987), Information Retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Ponte

A probabilistic language model calculates the conditional probability of the next word given their contextual words, which are typically learned from large-scale text corpora. Taking the simplest language model for example, N-Gram estimates the conditional probabilities according to maximum likelihood over text corpora (Jurafsky, 2000). Recent years have also witnessed the advances of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as the state-of-the-art approach for language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010), in which the context is represented as a low-dimensional hidden state to predict the next word.
Those conventional language models including neural models typically assume words as atomic symbols and model sequential patterns at word level. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold to some extent. Let us consider the following example sentence for which people want to predict the next word in the blank,

The U.S. trade deﬁcit last year is initially

estimated to be 40 billion

.

People may ﬁrst realize a unit should be ﬁlled in, then realize it should be a currency unit. Based on the country this sentence is talking about, the U.S., one may conﬁrm it should be an American cur-

rency unit and predict the word dollars. Here, the unit, currency, and American can be regarded as basic semantic units of the word dollars. This process, however, has not been explicitly taken into consideration by conventional language models. That is, although in most cases words are atomic language units, words are not necessarily atomic semantic units for language modeling. We argue that explicitly modeling these atomic semantic units could improve both the performance and the interpretability of language models.
Linguists assume that there is a limited close set of atomic semantic units composing the semantic meanings of an open set of concepts (i.e. word senses). These atomic semantic units are named sememes (Dong and Dong, 2006).i Since sememes are naturally implicit in human languages, linguists have devoted much effort to explicitly annotate lexical sememes for words and build linguistic common-sense knowledge bases. HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) is one of the representative sememe knowledge bases, which annotates each Chinese word sense with its sememes. The philosophy of HowNet regards the parts and attributes of a concept can be well represented by sememes. HowNet has been widely utilized in many NLP tasks such as word similarity computation (Liu, 2002) and sentiment analysis (Fu et al., 2013). However, less effort has been devoted to exploring its effectiveness in language models, especially neural language models.
It is non-trivial for neural language models to incorporate discrete sememe knowledge, as it is not compatible with continuous representations in neural models. In this paper, we propose a Sememe-Driven Language Model (SDLM) to leverage lexical sememe knowledge. In order to predict the next word, we design a novel sememesense-word generation process: (1) We ﬁrst estimate sememes’ distribution according to the context. (2) Regarding these sememes as experts, we propose a sparse product of experts method to select the most probable senses. (3) Finally, the distribution of words could be easily calculated by marginalizing out the distribution of senses.
We evaluate the performance of SDLM on the language modeling task using a Chinese news-

paper corpus People’s Daily ii (Renmin Ribao), and also on the headline generation task using the Large Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization (LCSTS) dataset (Hu et al., 2015). Experimental results show that SDLM outperforms all those data-driven baseline models. We also conduct case studies to show that our model can effectively predict relevant sememes given context, which can improve the interpretability and robustness of language models.

2 Background

Language models target at learning the

joint probability of a sequence of words

P (w1, w2, · · · , wn), which is usually factor-

ized as P (w1, w2, · · · , wn) =

n t=1

P

(wt

|w<t

).

Bengio et al. (2003) propose the ﬁrst Neural Lan-

guage Model as a feed-forward neural network.

Mikolov et al. (2010) use RNN and a softmax

layer to model the conditional probability. To be

speciﬁc, it can be divided into two parts in series. First, a context vector gt is derived from a deep

recurrent neural network. Then, the probability P (wt+1|w≤t) = P (wt+1; gt) is derived from a

linear layer followed by a softmax layer based on gt. Let RNN(·, ·; θNN) denote the deep

recurrent neural network, where θNN denotes the

parameters. The ﬁrst part can be formulated as

gt = RNN(xwt , {htl−1}Ll=1; θNN). (1)

Here we use subscripts to denote layers and superscripts to denote timesteps. Thus htl represents the hidden state of the L-th layer at timestep t. xwt ∈ RH0 is the input embedding of word wt where H0 is the input embedding size. We also have gt ∈ RH1, where H1 is the dimension of the context vector.
Supposing that there are N words in the lan-
guage we want to model, the second part can be
written as

t+1 t

exp(gtTwwt+1 )

P (w ; g ) =

exp(gtTw

, )

(2)

where ww is the output embedding of word w and w1, w2, · · · wN ∈ RH2. Here H2 is the output embedding size. For a conventional neural lan-
guage model, H2 always equals to H1.

3 Methodology

In this section, we present our SDLM which uti-
lizes sememe information to predict the probabil-
ity of the next word. SDLM is composed of three
modules in series: Sememe Predictor, Sense Pre-
dictor and Word Predictor. The Sememe Predictor
ﬁrst takes the context vector as input and assigns a
weight to each sememe. Then each sememe is re-
garded as an expert and makes predictions about
the probability distribution over a set of senses
in the Sense Predictor. Finally, the probability of
each word is obtained in the Word Predictor.
Here we use an example shown in Figure 2 to illustrate our architecture. Given context 我在果 园摘 “In the orchard, I pick”, the actual next word could be 苹果 “apples”. From the context, especially the word 果园 “orchard” and 摘 “pick”, we
can infer that the next word probably represents
a kind of fruit. So the Sememe Predictor assigns a higher weight to the sememe 水果 “fruit” (0.9) and lower weights to irrelevant sememes like 电 脑 “computer” (0.1). Therefore in the Sense Predictor, the sense 苹果 (水果) “apple (fruit)” is assigned a much higher probability than the sense 苹 果 (电脑) “apple (computer)”. Finally, the probability of the word 苹果 “apple” is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of its senses 苹果 (水

果) “apple(fruit)” and 苹果 (电脑) “apple (computer)”.
In the following subsections, we ﬁrst introduce the word-sense-sememe hierarchy in HowNet, and then give details about our SDLM.
3.1 Word-Sense-Sememe Hierarchy
We also use the example of “apple” to illustrate the word-sense-sememe hierarchy. As shown in Figure 3, the word 苹果 “apple” has two senses, one is the Apple brand, the other is a kind of fruit. Each sense is annotated with several sememes organized in a hierarchical structure. More speciﬁcally, in HowNet, sememes “PatternVal”, “bring”, “SpeBrand”, “computer” and “able” are annotated with the word “apple” and organized in a tree structure. In this paper, we ignore the structural relationship between sememes. For each word, we group all its sememes as an unordered set.
We present the notations that we use in the following subsections as follows. We deﬁne the overall sememe, sense, and word set as E, S and W. And we suppose the corpus contains K = |E| sememes, M = |S| senses and N = |W| words. For word w ∈ W, we denote its corresponding sense set as S(w). For sense s ∈ S(w), we denote its corresponding sememes as an unordered set E (s) = {en1 , en2 , · · · , enk } ⊂ E = {ek}Kk=1.
3.2 Sememe Predictor
The Sememe Predictor takes the context vector g ∈ RH1 as input and assigns a weight to each sememe. We assume that given the context w1, w2, · · · , wt−1, the events that word wt contains sememe ek (k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , K}) are independent, since the sememe is the minimum semantic unit and there is no semantic overlap between any two different sememes. For simplicity, we ignore

the superscript t. We design the Sememe Predictor as a linear decoder with the sigmoid activation function. Therefore, qk, the probability that the next word contains sememe ek, is formulated as

qk = P (ek|g) = σ(gTvk + bk),

(4)

where vk ∈ RH1, bk ∈ R are trainable parameters, and σ(·) denotes the sigmoid activation function.

3.3 Sense Predictor and Word Predictor
The architecture of the Sense Predictor is moti-
vated by Product of Experts (PoE) (Hinton, 1999).
We regard each sememe as an expert that only
makes predictions on the senses connected with it. Let D(ek) denote the set of senses that contain sememe ek, the k-th expert. Different from conventional neural language models, which directly use the inner product of the context vector g ∈ RH1 and the output embedding ww ∈ RH2 for word w to generate the score for each word, we use φ(k)(g, w) to calculate the score given by expert ek. And we choose a bilinear function parameterized with a matrix Uk ∈ RH1×H2 as a straight implementation of φ(k)(·, ·):

φ(k)(g, w) = gTUkw.

(5)

Let ws denote the output embedding of sense
s. The score of sense s provided by sememe expert ek can be written as φ(k)(g, ws). Therefore, P (ek)(s|g), the probability of sense s given by ex-
pert ek, is formulated as

P (ek)(s|g) =

exp(qkCk,sφ(k)(g, ws))

, (6)

s ∈D(ek) exp(qkCk,s φ(k)(g, ws ))

where Ck,s is a normalization constant because sense s is not connected to all experts (the connections are sparse with approximately λN edges, λ < 5). Here we can choose either Ck,s = 1/|E(s)| (left normalization) or Ck,s = 1/ |E(s)||D(ek)| (symmetric normalization).
In the Sense Predictor, qk can be viewed as a gate which controls the magnitude of the term Ck,sφ(k)(g, wws), thus control the ﬂatness of the sense distribution provided by sememe expert ek. Consider the extreme case when qk → 0, the prediction will converge to the discrete uniform dis-
tribution. Intuitively, it means that the sememe ex-
pert will refuse to provide any useful information
when it is not likely to be related to the next word.
Finally, we summarize the predictions on sense s by taking the product of the probabilities given

by relevant experts and then normalize the result; that is to say, P (s|g), the probability of sense s, satisﬁes

P (s|g) ∝

P (ek)(s|g).

(7)

ek ∈E(s)

Using Equation 5 and 6, we can formulate P (s|g) as

P (s|g) =

exp( ek∈E(s) qkCk,sgTUkws) . (8) s exp( ek∈E(s ) qkCk,s gTUkws )

It should be emphasized that all the supervision information provided by HowNet is embodied in the connections between the sememe experts and the senses. If the model wants to assign a high probability to sense s, it must assign a high probability to some of its relevant sememes. If the model wants to assign a low probability to sense s, it can assign a low probability to its relevant sememes. Moreover, the prediction made by sememe expert ek has its own tendency because of its own φ(k)(·, ·). Besides, the sparsity of connections between experts and senses is also determined by HowNet itself. For our dataset, on average, a word is connected with 3.4 sememe experts and each sememe expert will make predictions about 22 senses.
As illustrated in Figure 2, in the Word Predictor, we get P (w|g), the probability of word w, by summing up probabilities of corresponding s given by the Sense Predictor, that is

P (w|g) =

P (s|g).

3.4 Implementation Details
Basis Matrix Actually, HowNet contains K ≈ 2000 sememes. In practice, we cannot directly introduce K × H1 × H2 parameters, which might be computationally infeasible and lead to overﬁtting. To address this problem, we apply a weightsharing trick called the basis matrix. We use R basis matrices and their weighted sum to estimate Uk :

Uk = αk,rQr,

where Qr ∈ RH1×H2, αk,r > 0 are trainable pa-

rameters, and

Weight Tying To incorporate the weight tying

strategy (Inan et al., 2017; Press and Wolf, 2017),

we use the same output embedding for multiple

senses of a word. To be speciﬁc, the sense output embedding ws for each s ∈ S(w) is the same as the word input embedding xw.
4 Experiments
We evaluate our SDLM on a Chinese language modeling dataset, namely People’s Daily based on perplexity.iii Furthermore, to show that our SDLM structure can be a generic Chinese word-level decoder for sequence-to-sequence learning, we conduct a Chinese headline generation experiment on the LCSTS dataset. Finally, we explore the interpretability of our model with cases, showing the effectiveness of utilizing sememe knowledge.
4.1 Language Modeling
Dataset
We choose the People’s Daily Corpus, which is widely used for Chinese NLP tasks, as the resource. It contains one month’s news text from People’s Daily (Renmin Ribao). Taking Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) as a reference, we build a dataset for Chinese language modeling based on the People’s Daily Corpus with 734k, 10k and 19k words in the training, validation and test set. After the preprocessing similar to (Mikolov et al., 2010) (see Appendix A), we get our dataset and the ﬁnal vocabulary size is 13,476.
Baseline
As for baselines, we consider three kinds of neural language modeling architectures with LSTM cells: simple LSTM, Tied LSTM and AWD-LSTM. LSTM and Tied LSTM Zaremba et al. (2014) use the dropout strategy to prevent overﬁtting for neural language models and adopt it to two-layer LSTMs with different embedding and hidden size: 650 for medium LSTM, and 1500 for large LSTM. Employing the weight tying strategy, we get Tied LSTM with better performance. We set LSTM and Tied LSTM of medium and large size as our baseline models and use the code from PyTorch examplesiv as their implementations. AWD-LSTM Based on several strategies for regularizing and optimizing LSTM-based language models, Merity et al. (2018) propose AWD-LSTM
iii Although we only conduct experiments on Chinese corpora, we argue that this model has the potential to be applied to other languages in the light of works on construction sememe knowledge bases for other languages, such as (Qi et al., 2018).
iv https://github.com/pytorch/examples/ tree/master/word_language_model

as a three-layer neural network, which serves as a very strong baseline for word-level language modeling. We build it with the code released by the authorsv. Variants of Softmax Meanwhile, to compare our SDLM with other language modeling decoders, we set cHSM (Class-based Hierarchical Softmax) (Goodman, 2001), tHSM (Tree-based Hierarchical Softmax) (Mikolov et al., 2013) and MoS (Mixture of Softmaxes) (Yang et al., 2018) as the baseline add-on structures to the architectures above.
Experimental Settings
We apply our SDLM and other variants of softmax structures to the architectures mentioned above: LSTM (medium / large), Tied LSTM (medium / large) and AWD-LSTM. MoS and SDLM are only applied on the models that incorporate weight tying, while tHSM is only applied on the models without weight tying, since it is not compatible with this strategy.
For a fair comparison, we train these models with same experimental settings and conduct a hyper-parameter search for baselines as well as our models (the search setting and the optimal hyper-parameters can be found in Appendix C.1). We keep using these hyper-parameters in our SDLM for all architectures. It should be emphasized that we use the SGD optimizer for all architectures, and we decrease the learning rate by a factor of 2 if no improvement is observed on the validation set. We uniformly initialize the word embeddings, the class embeddings for cHSM and the non-leaf embeddings for tHSM in [−0.1, 0.1]. In addition, we set R, the number of basis matrices, to 5 in Tied LSTM architecture and to 10 in AWD-LSTM architecture. We choose the left normalization strategy because it performs better.
Experimental Results
Table 1 shows the perplexity on the validation and test set of our models and the baseline models. From Table 1, 2, and 3, we can observe that: 1. Our models outperform the corresponding baseline models of all structures, which indicates the effectiveness of our SDLM. Moreover, our SDLM not only consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MoS model, but also offers much better interpretability (as described in Sect. 4.3), which

makes it possible to interpret the prediction process of the language model. Note that under a fair comparison, we do not see MoS’s improvement over AWD-LSTM while our SDLM outperforms it by 1.20 with respect to perplexity on the test set. 2. To further locate the performance improvement of our SDLM, we study the perplexity of the single-sense words and multi-sense words separately on Tied LSTM (medium) and Tied LSTM (medium) + SDLM. Improvements with respect to perplexity are presented in Table 2. The performance on both single-sense words and multi-sense words gets improved while multi-sense words beneﬁt more from SDLM structure because they have richer sememe information. 3. In Table 3 we study the perplexity of words with different mean number of sememes. We can see that our model outperforms baselines in all cases and is expected to beneﬁt more as the mean number of sememes increases. 1.

Improvements with respect to perplexity are presented in Table 2. The performance on both single-sense words and multi-sense words gets improved while multi-sense words beneﬁt more from SDLM structure because they have richer sememe information. 3. In Table 3 we study the perplexity of words with different mean number of sememes. We can see that our model outperforms baselines in all cases and is expected to beneﬁt more as the mean number of sememes increases.
We also test the robustness of our model by randomly removing 10% sememe-sense connections in HowNet. The test perplexity for Tied LSTM (medium) + SDLM slightly goes up to 97.67, compared to 97.32 with a complete HowNet, which shows that our model is robust to tiny incompleteness of annotations. However, the performance of out model is still largely dependent upon the accuracy of sememe annotations. As HowNet is continuously updated, we expect our model to perform better with sememe knowledge of higher quality.
4.2 Headline Generation
Dataset
We use the LCSTS dataset to evaluate our SDLM structure as the decoder of the sequence-tosequence model. As its author suggests, we divide the dataset into the training set, the validation set and the test set, whose sizes are 2.4M, 8.7k and 725 respectively. Details can be found in Appendix B.

Models
For this task, we consider two models for comparison.
RNN-context As described in (Bahdanau et al., 2015), RNN-context is a basic sequence-tosequence model with a bi-LSTM encoder, an LSTM decoder and attention mechanism adopted. The context vector is concatenated with the word embedding at each timestep when decoding. It’s widely used for sequence-to-sequence learning, so we set it as the baseline model.
RNN-context-SDLM Based on RNN-context, we substitute the decoder with our proposed SDLM and name it RNN-context-SDLM.
Experimental Settings
We implement our models with PyTorch, on top of the OpenNMT librariesv. For both models, we set the word embedding size to 250, the hidden unit size to 250, the vocabulary size to 40000, and the beam size of the decoder to 5. For RNN-contextSDLM, we set the number of basis matrices to 3. We conduct a hyper-parameter search for both models (see Appendix C.2 for settings and optimal hyper-parameters).
Experimental Results
Following previous works, we report the F1-score of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L on the test set. Table 4 shows that our model outperforms the baseline model on all metrics. We attribute the improvement to the use of SDLM structure.
Words in headlines do not always appear in the corresponding articles. However, words with the same sememes have a high probability to appear in the articles intuitively. Therefore, a probable reason for the improvement is that our model could predict sememes highly relevant to the article, thus generate more accurate headlines. This could be corroborated by our case study.

4.3 Case Study The above experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our SDLM. Here we present some samples
v http://opennmt.net

from the test set of the People’s Daily Corpus in Table 5 as well as the LCSTS dataset in Table 6 and conduct further analysis.
For each example of language modeling, given the context of previous words, we list the Top 5 words and Top 5 sememes predicted by our SDLM. The target words and the sememes annotated with them in HowNet are blackened. Note that if the target word is an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word, helpful sememes that are related to the target meaning are blackened.
Sememes annotated with the corresponding sense of the target word 美元 “dollar” are 单位 “unit”, 商业 “commerce”, 金融 “ﬁnance”, 货币 “money” and 美国 “US”. In Example (1), the target word “dollar” is predicted correctly and most of its sememes are activated in the predicting process. It indicates that our SDLM has learned the word-sense-sememe hierarchy and used sememe knowledge to improve language modeling.
Example (2) shows that our SDLM can provide interpretable results on OOV word prediction with sememe information associated with it. The target word here should be the name of the Albanian prime minister, which is out of vocabulary. But with our model, one can still conclude that this word is probably relevant to the sememe “politics”, “person”, “ﬂowers”, “undertake” and “waters”, most of which characterize the meaning of this OOV word – the name of a politician. This feature can be helpful when the vocabulary size is limited or there are many terminologies and names in the corpus.

Article 8 日 ， 阜 新 一 开 宝马 轿车 参加 高考 的 男 考生 考场 作弊 被 抓 ， 因 不满 监考 老师 没收 作弊 手 机 ， 从 背后 一 脚 将 女 监考 老师 从 最后 一 排 踹 到 讲台 。 并 口 出 狂 言 ： “ 你 知道 我 爸 是 谁 啊 ， 你 就 查 我 ？ ” 目前 ， 打人 考生 已 被拘留 。 On the 8th in Fuxin, a male student drove a BMW to take the college entrance exam and was caught cheating. Because the teacher conﬁscated his mobile phone, he kicked the teacher from the last row to the podium and shouted: ”Do you know who my dad is? How dare you catch me!” Currently, this student has been detained.

“predict”, all other Top 5 predicted sememes have high relevance to either the predicted word or the context. To be speciﬁc, the sememe 学习 “study” is annotated with 生 “student” in HowNet. 考 试 “exam” indicates “college entrance exam”. 特 定 牌 子 “brand” indicates “BMW”. And 高 等 “higher” indicates “higher education”, which is the next step after this exam. We can conclude that with sememe knowledge, our SDLM structure can extract critical information from both the given article and generated words explicitly and produce better summarization based on it.
5 Related Work
Neural Language Modeling. RNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the language modeling task since Mikolov et al. (2010) ﬁrst apply RNNs for language modeling. Much work has been done to improve RNN-based language modeling. For example, a variety of work (Zaremba et al., 2014; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016; Merity et al., 2017, 2018) introduces many regularization and optimization methods for RNNs. Based on the observation that the word appearing in the previous context is more likely to appear again, some work (Grave et al., 2017a,b) proposes to use cache for improvements. In this paper, we mainly focus on the output decoder, the module between the context vector and the

predicted probability distribution. Similar to our SDLM, Yang et al. (2018) propose a high-rank model which adopts a Mixture of Softmaxes structure for the output decoder. However, our model is sememe-driven with each expert corresponding to an interpretable sememe.
Hierarchical Decoder Since softmax computation on large vocabulary is time-consuming, therefore being a dominant part of the model’s complexity, various hierarchical softmax models have been proposed to address this issue. These models can be categorized to class-based models and tree-based models according to their hierarchical structure. Goodman (2001) ﬁrst proposes the class-based model which divides the whole vocabulary into different classes and uses a hierarchical softmax decoder to model the probability as P(word) = P(word|class)P(class), which is similar to our model. For the tree-based models, all words are organized in a tree structure and the word probability is calculated as the probability of always choosing the correct child along the path from the root node to the word node. While Morin and Bengio (2005) utilize knowledge from WordNet to build the tree, Mnih and Hinton (2008) build it in a bootstrapping way and Mikolov et al. (2013) construct a Huffman Tree based on word frequencies. Recently, Jiang et al. (2017) reform the tree-based structure to make it more efﬁcient on GPUs. The major differences between our model and theirs are the purpose and the motivation. Our model targets at improving the performance and interpretability of language modeling using external knowledge in HowNet. Therefore, we take its philosophy of the word-sensesememe hierarchy to design our hierarchical decoder. Meanwhile, the class-based and tree-based models are mainly designed to speed up the softmax computation in the training process.
Sememe. Recently, there are a lot of works concentrating on utilizing sememe knowledge in traditional natural language processing tasks. For example, Niu et al. (2017) use sememe knowledge to improve the quality of word embeddings and cope with the problem of word sense disambiguation. Xie et al. (2017) apply matrix factorization to predict sememes for words. Jin et al. (2018) improve their work by incorporating character-level information. Our work extends the previous works and tries to combine word-sense-sememe hierar-

chy with the sequential model. To be speciﬁc, this is the ﬁrst work to improve the performance and interpretability of Neural Language Modeling with sememe knowledge.
Product of Experts. As Hinton (1999, 2002) propose, the ﬁnal probability can be calculated as the product of probabilities given by experts.Gales and Airey (2006) apply PoE to the speech recognition where each expert is a Gaussian mixture model. Unlike their work, in our SDLM, each expert is mapped to a sememe with better interpretability. Moreover, as the ﬁnal distribution is a categorical distribution, each expert is only responsible for making predictions on a subset of the categories (usually less than 10), so we call it Sparse Product of Experts.
Headline Generation. Headline generation is a kind of text summarization tasks. In recent years, with the advances of RNNs, a lot of works have been done in this domain. The encoderdecoder models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) have achieved great success in sequenceto-sequence learning. Rush et al. (2015) propose a local attention-based model for abstractive sentence summarization. Gu et al. (2016) introduce the copying mechanism which is close to the rote memorization of the human being. Ayana et al. (2016) employ the minimum risk training strategy to optimize model parameters. Different from these works, we focus on the decoder of the sequence-to-sequence model, and adopt SDLM to utilize sememe knowledge for sentence generation.
6 Conclusion and Further Work
In this paper, we propose an interpretable Sememe-Driven Language Model with a hierarchical sememe-sense-word decoder. Besides interpretability, our model also achieves stateof-the-art performance in the Chinese Language Modeling task and shows improvement in the Headline Generation task. These results indicate that SDLM can successfully take advantages of sememe knowledge.
As for future work, we plan the following research directions: (1) In language modeling, given a sequence of words, a sequence of corresponding sememes can also be obtained. We will utilize the context sememe information for better sememe and word prediction. (2) Structural infor-

mation about sememes in HowNet is ignored in our work. We will extend our model with the hierarchical sememe tree for more accurate relations between words and their sememes. (3) It is imaginable that the performance of SDLM will be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the annotation quality of sememe knowledge. We will also devote to further enrich the sememe knowledge for new words and phrases, and investigate its effect on SDLM.

A Details about Preprocessing of the People’s Daily Dataset
In this section, we describe the details about preprocessing of the People’s Daily dataset.
Firstly, we treat sentence, which is segmented by particular punctuations, as the minimum unit and then shufﬂe the corpus. We split the corpus into the training set, the validation set and the test set, which contain 734k, 10k, 19k words respectively. Similar to the preprocessing performed in (Mikolov et al., 2010), we replace the number with <N>, the speciﬁc date with <date>, the year with <year>, and the time with <time>. Different from the preprocessing of the English language modeling dataset, we keep the punctuations and therefore do not append <eos> at the end of each sentence. Those words that occur less than 5 times are replaced with <unk>.
Since our model requires that every word should be included in the dictionary of HowNet, we segment each non-annotated word into annotated words with the forward maximum matching algorithm.
B Details about Preprocessing of the LCSTS Dataset
In this section, we describe the details about preprocessing of the LCSTS dataset.
The dataset consists of over 2 million articleheadline pairs collected from Sina Weibo, the most popular social media network in China. It’s composed of three parts. Each pair from PARTII and PART-III is labeled with a score which indicates the relevance between the article and its headline. As its author suggests, we take pairs from a subset of PART-II as the validation set and a subset of PART-III as the test set. Only pairs with score 3, 4 and 5, which means high relevance, are taken into account. We take pairs from PART-I that do not occur in the validation set as the training set.
Similar to what we do for preprocessing the People’s Daily dataset, the word segmentation is carried out with jiebavi based on the dictionary of HowNet to alleviate the OOV problems.

parameters used in the experiment.
C.1 Language Modeling
The hyper-parameters are chosen according to the performance on the validation set. For medium (Tied) LSTM and its cHSM, tHSM variants, we search the dropout rate from {0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7}. For large (Tied) LSTM and its cHSM, tHSM variants, we search the dropout rate from {0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8}. For AWD-LSTM and its variants, we follow most of the hyper-parameters described in (Merity et al., 2018) and only search the dropout rates (embedding V-dropout from {0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5}, hidden state V-dropout from {0.2, 0.25, 0.3}, word level V-dropout from {0.05, 0.1, 0.15} and context vector dropout from {0.4, 0.5}). For our SDLM and MoS, we ﬁx all other hyper-parameters and only search the dropout rates of the last two layers respectively from {0.35, 0.4, 0.45} and {0.25, 0.3}. The initial learning rate for MoS on the top of AWD-LSTM is set to 20 to avoid diverging.
For (Tied) LSTM, we set the hidden unit and word embedding size to 650 (medium) / 1500 (large), batch size to 20, bptt to 35, dropout rate to 0.6 (medium) / 0.7 (large) and initial learning rate to 20. The optimal dropout rates for cHSM and tHSM are 0.55 (cHSM, medium), 0.5 (cHSM, medium, tied), 0.7 (cHSM, large), 0.65 (cHSM, large, tied), 0.55 (tHSM, medium) and 0.7 (tHSM, large). For AWD-LSTM and its variants, the hyper-parameters for the baseline are summarized in Table 7.
C.2 Headline Generation
The hyper-parameters are chosen according to the performance on the validation set. For RNN-context, we search the dropout rate from {0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35}, the batch size from {32, 64} and try SGD and Adam optimizers. For RNN-context-SDLM, we search the dropout

rate from {0.15, 0.2, 0.25}, the batch size from {32, 64} and try SGD and Adam optimizers.
For RNN-context, we use Adam optimizer with starting learning rate 0.001. The batch size is 32 and the dropout rate is 0.15. For RNN-contextSDLM, we use Adam optimizer with starting learning rate 0.001. The batch size is 64 and the dropout rate is 0.2.
